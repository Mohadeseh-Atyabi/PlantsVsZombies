We all have a very good memory with the game Plants VS Zombie, which was first released for personal computers and then made its way to smart phones and game consoles, and now there are few users who have not experienced this lovely game. . In this project, we intend to implement the initial version of this game. The goal of this game is to save the player's house from evil zombies with the help of plants in the yard. The map of this game is a 5x9 table where the player can plant a plant in each house. Each of the plants will damage the zombies in some way, or give the player more points to plant plants. 

To learn more about the entities of the game and how to do it, you can read [this file](final_project_AP_99.pdf). For a better understanding of the game environment, you can also download the game from this [link](https://dl.yasdl.com/Game2013/Plants.Zombies.2012.Final_%5bYasDL.com%5d.zip?ghgf).
